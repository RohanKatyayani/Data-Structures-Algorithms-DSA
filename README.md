# 🚀 Consistent DSA Practice Repo  
### From Fundamentals to Advanced (DP, Graphs, Backtracking) in Python  

This repository is my journey of practicing **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** consistently to build strong problem-solving skills for **technical interviews (MAANG & top companies)**.  

Every day, I solve problems across different topics — starting from **Arrays & Strings** and moving up to **Dynamic Programming, Graphs, and Backtracking**. Each folder contains **solutions + notes** for easy reference.

## 📅 Plan

- **Step 1** → Arrays, Strings, Hashing  
- **Step 2** → Linked List, Stack, Queue  
- **Step 3** → Trees & Graphs  
- **Step 4** → Greedy, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming  
- **Step 5** → Mock Interviews & Final Review
